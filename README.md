TODO
-----
- Consider moving back to observers
- Along with previous, make rerendering smarter

- Add ability to move legend code above main chart.
- More thorough documentation, especially event handlers.
- Show some indication that no data was provided.
- Build process to separate out the different components.
- Move the tooltip div as an element inside the svg? (allows better transitions
    than jquery)
- Use arrayComputed for the data attribute?
