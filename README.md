- Add non-stacked bar charts.
- More thorough documentation, especially event handlers.
- Show some indication that no data was provided.
- Build process to separate out the different components.
- Move the tooltip div as an element inside the svg? (allows better transitions
    than jquery)
- Use arrayComputed for the data attribute?
