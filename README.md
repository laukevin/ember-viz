TODO
-----

- Fix context chart axis when data changes
- Axis labels for multi-year, maybe even just show the year if the data being
    displayed isn't the current year.
- Add area charts
- Add ability to move legend code above main chart.
- Consolidate the legend code between charts.
- Add non-stacked bar charts.
- More thorough documentation, especially event handlers.
- Show some indication that no data was provided.
- Build process to separate out the different components.
- Move the tooltip div as an element inside the svg? (allows better transitions
    than jquery)
- Use arrayComputed for the data attribute.

Done
----
- Add stacked bar charts
- Add clip path to line-chart.
